Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed a new set of (optional) tax slabs that has lower tax rates compared to the existing rates.

She said in her budget speech that the Current Income Tax Act is full of various exemptions and deductions that make compliance complicated and a burdensome process for the taxpayers. The old income tax regime gives taxpayer the benefit of a 100-odd exemptions while the new regime makes to forego around 70 exemptions in exchange for a lower tax slab.

### Option to choose

The tax payer, at the time filing of income tax returns (ITR), will have an option to choose between any one of the tax regimes and it is advisable to do a comparison before opting.

It is notable that, the choice can be exercised every year and any regime which is beneficial can be adopted by the individual (except for those who have income from business or profession). Individuals who have income from business or profession cannot switch between the new and old tax regimes every year. If they opt for the new taxation regime, such individuals get only one chance in their lifetime to go back to the old regime. Further, once switched back to existing tax regime, they will not be able opt for new tax regime unless their business income ceases to exist.

### Circular

Further, the tax authorities also issued a circular recently detailing the process to follow by employers, this year while deducting tax from April onwards.

The circular directed employers to enquire their employees to choose between old or new tax regime in the beginning of the year itself. If the employee do not explicitly express his/ her wish to switch to the new regime, the existing regime will be the default option.

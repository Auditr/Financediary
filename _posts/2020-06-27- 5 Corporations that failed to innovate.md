### 1. Kodak:  

Kodak, a technology company that dominate the photographic film market during 2000s. The company blew its chance to lead the digital photography revolution as they were in denial 
for too long. Kodak  developed the world’s first consumer digital camera but failed to get approval fearing for the loss of demand for film market.  

Kodak focused more on the film success that it couldn’t survive when the rivals came into market with digital camera. Digital camera market disrupts the complete film market which was a complete shock for Kodak where it failed to come up with innovation. The cost of this failure is exit from the market. Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012.

### 2. Nokia: 
Nokia, a company founded in Finland was the first to create a cellular network in the world. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Nokia was the global leader in mobile phones. With the arrival of the Internet, other mobile companies started understanding how data, not voice, was the future of communication. Nokia didn’t grasp the concept of software and kept focusing on hardware because the management feared to alienate current users if they changed too much.  

In 2007 Steve Jobs launched the iPhone, a phone without a keyboard, which was revolutionary at the time. People were gone mad when they first saw a phone without a keyboard and  this might be the reason why people are selling their kidneys to afford an iPhone. In 2008 Nokia finally made the decision to compete with Android, but it was too late.  

### 3. Xerox: 

The name Xerox is so  popular that it become the synonym for photocopying. It is still the same even today and the digital world won’t kill this in coming time.  
But when it comes to personal computer, Xerox was actually first to invent the PC and their product was way ahead of its time. Unfortunately, the management thought going digital would be too expensive and they never bothered to exploit the opportunities they had. The CEO was convinced that the future of Xerox was in copy machines. 

### 4. Enron:   

“The story of Enron Corp. is the story of a company that reached dramatic heights, only to face a dizzying fall. Its collapse affected thousands of employees and shook Wall Street to its core. At Enron’s peak, its shares were worth $90.75; when it declared bankruptcy on December 2, 2001, they were trading at $0.26.”    - Investopedia - 

Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company, which was named as America’s most innovative company by Fortune from 1996 to 2001. At the end of the 1990s, the Dotcom Bubble was on the rise and Enron decided to participate by creating Enron Online in 1999, an electronic trading website. By mid-2000 EOL was executing nearly $350 billion in trades. 

The CEO of that time Jeffrey Skilling had been hiding the losses from the company. When Ken Lay took over as CEO in 2001 Enron’s broadband division reported a massive $137 million loss. In December, Enron filed for bankruptcy and in 2002 the Justice Department launched a criminal investigation, where Enron’s accounting firm, Arthur Andersen was convicted of obstructing justice.

### 5. Blockbuster:  

Blockbuster is a video rental company which was leading the market till 2004. Their rental business on VHS (Video Home System) is actually blockbuster and it survived the change from VHS to DVD.  
And there comes Netflix into the market. While Netflix was shipping out DVD’s to their consumer’s homes, Blockbuster figured their physical stores were enough to please their customers. Because they had been the leader of the movie rental market for years, management didn’t see why they should change their strategy.  

The failure of Blockbuster is a suicide. In the starting days of Netflix which initially approached Blockbuster with a proposal that Blockbuster to advertise  their brand in the stores while Netflix would run Blockbuster online. The idea got turned down by Antioco because he thought it was ridiculous and Netflix taking advantage of the brand Blockbuster.

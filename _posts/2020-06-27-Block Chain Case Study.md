Imagine, X your best friend, whose mother being unwell was admitted in the hospital and wants some money immediately for the operation. He calls you and says, “Y, I need some money. I have run out of it.” 

You reply, “Sending some right away,” and hung up. You then call your account manager at your bank and tell him, “Please transfer $1000 from my account to X's account.” Your account manager replies, “OK, sir.” 

He opens up the register, checks your account balance to see if you have enough balance to transfer $1000 to X. Because you have plenty thus, he makes an entry in your account like the following: Y --> $1000 to X You call X and tell him, “I’ve transferred the money. “ 

What just happened? You and X both trusted the bank to manage your money. There was no real movement of physical things to transfer the money. All that was needed was an entry in the register. The entry in that register that neither you nor X controls or owns.And this is the problem of the current systems. 

To establish trust between ourselves, we depend on individual third-parties from so many years. 
* What if that register in which the transaction was logged gets burnt in a fire? 
* What if, by mistake, your account manager had written $1200 instead of $1000? 
* What if he did that intentionally? 
* Could there be a system where we can still transfer money without needing the bank?

Think about it for a second, what does transferring money means? 
Just an entry in the register. Is there a way to maintain the register among ourselves instead of someone else does it for us? The blockchain is the answer to the profound question

In the simplest terms, Blockchain can be described as a data structure that holds transactional records and ensures security, transparency, and decentralization. You can also think of it as a chain or records stored in the forms of blocks which are controlled by no single authority.A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is completely open to any and everyone on the network. Once an information is stored on a blockchain, it is extremely difficult to change or alter it.Each transaction on a blockchain is secured with a digital signature that proves its authenticity. Due to the use of encryption and digital signatures, the data stored on the blockchain is tamper-proof and cannot be changed.

Blockchain technology allows all the network participants to reach an agreement, commonly known as consensus. All the data stored on a blockchain is recorded digitally and has a common history which is available for all the network participants. This way, the chances of any fraudulent activity or duplication of transactions is eliminated without the need of a third-party.

Referring to the example given above, instead of using a bank for transferring money, if we use a blockchain in such cases, the process becomes much easier and secure. There is no extra fee involved as the funds are directly processed by you thus, eliminating the need for a third party.Moreover, the blockchain database is decentralized and is not limited to any single location meaning that all the information and records kept on the blockchain are public and decentralized. Since the information is not stored in a single place, there’s no chance of corruption of the information by any hacker.

There’s a common misconception among people that Bitcoin and Blockchain are one and the same, however, that is not the case. Creating cryptocurrencies is one of the applications of Blockchain technology and other than Bitcoin, there are numerous applications that are being developed on the basis of the blockchain technology.
Bitcoin is nothing but a form of digital currency (cryptocurrency) which can be used in the place of fiat money for trading. And the underlying technology behind the success of cryptocurrencies is termed as Blockchain.
